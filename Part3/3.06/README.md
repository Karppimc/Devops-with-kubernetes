# Exercise 3.06: DBaaS vs DIY

## Task:
- Do a pros/cons comparison of the solutions in terms of meaningful differences. This includes at least the required work and costs to initialize as well as the        maintenance. Backup methods and their ease of usage should be considered as well.

Write your answer in the README of the project.


## Answer:
### DBaas (Database as a service)
1. Pros
- Easy to setup
- Low maintenance,updates are done automatically
- Ingegrated backups
- Scalable
- Professional support from the provider
2. Cons
- Cost is higher due to premium services
- You are dependent on single cloud provider
- Limited control

### DIY
1. Pros
- Cost-effective, lower initial costs if you have required hardware of course.
- Full control for configuration and optimizing
- Flexible, you can choose any database type, version etc.
- Independent from any cloud providers
2. Cons
- Requires work to setup and configure
- Need to maintain/update/patch/monitor and scale
- Backupping can be complex
- Need for skilled database admin
- Risk of downtime if there is problems


### Summary

- DBaas can be more expensive but these costs are also predictable and you know what you pay for
- DBaas is quick to setup while DIY needs lot of work setting up and maintaining
- DBaas has automatic backupping
- DIY lets you have full control while DBaas is more for easier use
- DBaas is easier to scale up or down. DIY needs to be scaled manually and also you need to buy new hardware/install it etc. If you need to get more things.
